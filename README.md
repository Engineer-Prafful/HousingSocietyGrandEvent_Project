# HousingSocietyGrandEvent_Project
Incorporating Python and its libraries to process and analyse the data of a Housing Society

Our primary objective is to analyse the data that empowers the housing society to make data-driven decisions, optimize event planning, and ensure the efficient utilisation of resources.  By leveraging the decorator and caterer data, we aim to enhance the event experience, minimise costs, and maximise resident satisfaction. The selection of the best caterer and decorator based on customer satisfaction and cost-effectiveness will play a crucial role in achieving these goals and ensuring the success of the grand event. Analyzing the data and gaining insights for organizing the grand event by finding out following information with our analysis:

  <li>Demographic Analysis</li>
  <li>Flat Information</li>
  <li>Resident Participation</li>
  <li>Owner and Tenant Information</li>
  <li>Donations Analysis</li>
  <li>Event Planning</li>
  <li>Decorator and Caterer Analysis</li>
